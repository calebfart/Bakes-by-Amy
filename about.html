      <h2>About Amy's Bakes</h2>
      <p>
        Bakes by Amy was born out of North Carolina, founded by a passionate
        woman named Amy. With years of experience in the food industry, Amy
        started her journey at a local Food Lion. She began as a staff member in
        the deli and bakery department and, through hard work and dedication,
        gradually worked her way up the ranks to manager. Amy's commitment to
        excellence and love for baking were the driving forces behind her idea.
        In late 2024 and early 2025, after years of honing her skills and
        building her passion, she decided to take the leap and turn her dream
        into a reality. Bakes by Amy was established, offering a delicious
        variety of freshly baked treats, including cupcakes, cookies, cakes, and
        more. Amy's vision was to share her homemade, carefully crafted baked
        goods with the community, all made with love and the finest ingredients.
